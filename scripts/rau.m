%  Doing linear tests (like ANOVA or t-tests) on proportional data 
%  (values between 0 and 1) is difficult since the distributions of 
%  these values are not strictly Gaussian, especially when the 
%  proportions are near 0 or 1. The Rationalized Arcsine Transform 
%  linearizes the proportions and converts them to "rational arcsine 
%  units". The linear tests can then be performed on the RAU units. 
%  (p=0.5 roughly corresponds to a rau of 50).
%
%  RAU(p) computes the rationalized arcsine transform for a proportion
%  value p (0 <= p <= 1). p can also be a vector of proportion values.
% 
%  RAU(p,n) computes the rau-value assuming that the proportion p
%  was calculated using n values. A small n tends to flatten the 
%  RAU values.
%  
%  Based on: 
%    Studebaker, G. A. (1985). A 'rationalized' arcsine transform.

% Example 1:
%   p = 0:0.1:1; plot(100*p, rau(p), 'o-');
%   
% Example 2 (which reproduces Fig 1 in Studebaker, 1985):
%   p = 0:0.01:1; plot(100*p,rau(p)-(100*p));

% the advantage of this scaling is that RAU is roughly 
% equal to the percentage score from about 20% to 80%
% and only gets scaled beyond that.
